            Welcome to my website dude. My name is Kris Hass, and I have been coding for the past 4 years.
            I have only been using C++ and C#, and recently wanted to learn more languages, which includes
            learning frontend development, to become a true fullstack developer.
        </p>
        <p>
            So I am making this website to experiment with while I learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so yeah, coolio.
